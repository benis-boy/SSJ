<p><strong>Salandit-POV:</strong></p>
<p>Land ahoy! Yes! Finally! I have seen enough salt for a lifetime!</p>
<p>An island! It&#x27;s covered in a lush green thicket and has a beautiful, pearly white beach!</p>
<p>Master is still heading north, and since this is perfectly placed on our way, it means we can finally get a much needed distraction. At this point, I would take anything over this fucking endless salt.</p>
<p>A deserted island where we can cuddle up in calm, a dangerous island full of pokemon to fight, or even a secret boss; Anything is better than days of nothing but salt.</p>
<p>Lopunny walks ahead and takes the first step on top of the shore.</p>
<p><strong>Snap</strong></p>
<p>... Everyone stops at the sound. It sounded like a snapping bone or a dry branch, but it was just a seashell on the ground.</p>
<p>She presses on, head hanging in shame over being startled by a simple seashell.</p>
<p>I climb on top of Swole&#x27;s head to get a better overview. From here, to the horizon behind us is nothing but white salt.</p>
<p>To the left and right, all the way to the horizon, is only salt.</p>
<p>It really is just a teeny tiny island with a bunch of healthy-looking green plants on top.</p>
<p>I would call this sus.</p>
<p>But no matter how sus it is, I haven&#x27;t seen a plant in days, and I can&#x27;t believe how much I&#x27;d miss seeing one.</p>
<p>At first, plants were rather weird. They grow everywhere where the light shines. But I got used to them and their invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Master presses through a couple of plants and a vine slaps me in my face. Rude creatures.</p>
<p>I wonder if grass pokemon can talk to plants.</p>
<p>Another vine heads my way, but I dodge it by crawling into master&#x27;s backpack.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhhh! What is that? It smells really good!&quot; Something made Lopunny excited, and master turns on his flashlight. &quot;A whole steak sampling selection.&quot;</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I poke my head back out and look over Swole&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p>In front of us is a clearing of some sort. Green grass, surrounded by tall plants on all sides. A lavishly filled table stands in the center, with all sorts of meats, eggs and fruits, as well as what looks like the girliest cake I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Like 4 layers tall, covered in pink frosting, sprinkles and little hearts on top of whipped cream clouds.</p>
<p>It does look rather tasty.</p>
<p>&quot;Mega stones...&quot; Master points out a shelve stocked to the brim with rocks and marbles. &quot;And a Dusk Stone. Zoey needs one for Misdreavus.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a purple crystal with black center. It looks almost as if it attracts all light nearby.</p>
<p>A well for water, and the last item is an enormous bed. King-sized. Fitting for our trainer and us. And covered in romantic candles and rose petals.</p>
<p>&quot;Masster?&quot; I raise my voice and he wrestles his stare away from the clearing to look at me. &quot;This is pretty sussspicious, in my opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmh. It&#x27;s like all of our desires, randomly placed out in the open. This is a trap.&quot;</p>
<p>The shelve is really suspicious. It&#x27;s one of these store shelves from the pokemart.</p>
<p>No, actually, the food is even more conspicuous. Its fresh and still smells incredible.</p>
<p>And the bed: Perfect to have s--</p>
<p>Wait a minute. &quot;Whosse desire iss the romantic bed?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that skank of a rabbit, I bet. Always a step ahead of me.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that was your, to be honest.&quot; Master says.</p>
<p>&quot;The fruits and eggs are mine.&quot; I point the delectable things out. They seem to be made for me. I feel my acid salivating in my mouth already. &quot;Lopunny?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nnnope. As much as I would like to use it, I think the steaks are for me. Riolu?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Close. But it&#x27;s not pink enough... Why are you looking at me like that, Salandit?&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s such a hatchling sometimes. A- Ahhh. Right. Because she is. I keep forgetting.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind. If it&#x27;s none of uss, then it musst be master whose ssecret desire is to have hot. Ssteamy. Ssssex. Ouch!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. The rocks are for me.&quot; He poked my snoot! &quot;Maybe the trap maker is just messing with us. Either way, we have a dilemma at our hands.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#x27;s right. Are we fast enough to steal all that stuff before the trap springs on us, or not?</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re running out of water in one to two days. Assuming this island is in the middle of the salt desert, that means we might dehydrate before we get out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh. That sounds pretty bad.</p>
<p>&quot;Get ready. Expect that we get attacked.&quot;</p>
<p>He orders and I chose to get ready with my ever trusty Will-O-Wisp.</p>
<p>&quot;Get ready to use Toxic instead.&quot;</p>
<p>I pout, but I still switch to Toxic for no good reason. It&#x27;s still one of my weakest moves.</p>
<p>Carefully, our mount steps past the luxury articles and closer to the ancient-looking well. A simple, deep hole in the ground with a bucket attached to a rope.</p>
<p>It sticks out like a sore thumb. It&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t look prestine and proper.</p>
<p>Swole takes hold of the end of the rope and tosses the bucket down. After a while, a soft splash can be heard and he starts pulling the rope up again.</p>
<p>Nothing attacks us.</p>
<p>After another while, he hoists the bucket all the way up again and uses his trusty devon corp water filter (tm) to remove any bacteria or whatever could be down there.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind us!&quot; Riolu warns all of a sudden.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Ara ara. What do we have here?&quot; A voice comes from behind. As fast as I can, I turn my head to look over my shoulder.</p>
<p>She is invisible.</p>
<p>&quot;A little band of thieves trying to steal from me? My, oh my. We can&#x27;t have that, can we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Show yourself!&quot; Riolu shouts. I see the fur standing up on the back of her neck.</p>
<p>A psychic pokemon. Or ghost? Psychic would be really bad.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your lousy guard dog on a leash. And give it a muzzle while you&#x27;reat it. The way it bares her fangs at me, lets me smell that putrid odor of her mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>Either way, she oozes confidence, and she sounds powerful enough to back it up as well.</p>
<p>&quot;I- I don&#x27;t smell! ... Right, daddy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you&#x27;re are perfectly groomed. I make sure of it. She just wants to get under your skin.&quot; Swole ... he understood what she said?</p>
<p>In that case, she&#x27;s most likely psychic.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, you need to show yourself, if you want to discuss this supposed theft.&quot;</p>
<p>I nod along. Can&#x27;t open my mouth, or I threaten to reveal the prepared Toxic.</p>
<p>&quot;Why would I need to?&quot; She answers. &quot;You&#x27;re already perfectly capable of looking me in the eyes, somehow. Curious.&quot;</p>
<p>Right. Aura.</p>
<p>I trace the trajectory of his eyes and adjust my aim accordingly. She had projected her voice to be from the left.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsk. Alright.&quot; A shimmer appears in the air for a moment, before a tall figure emerges from it, as if stepping out from another dimension.</p>
<p>&quot;Hatterene.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s as tall as Lopunny and wears long blue hair that cascades down her body while hugging it tightly. It fades into pink before turning white, past her thighs.</p>
<p>Her hair-like clothing doesn&#x27;t hide a lot. Her massive boobs are quite obvious and awe inspiring</p>
<p>On the top of her head, she wears a wide brimmed witch&#x27;s hat made from the blue parts of her hair, and on top of that grows a long tentacle with a three-fingered hand at the tip.</p>
<p>//// mention the eerie silence on the island.</p>
//// add a throne and a podium with the champions cup 
<p>Her size is quite impressive. Both vertically, as well as her cup size. </p>
<p>&quot;Ara ara. Where are your eyes wandering now? That&#x27;s quite rude for water thieves to do. Now, what shall I do with a rude bunch like you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shush. I know what we will do.&quot; She moves her tentacle to support her breasts. &quot;I will ask you three riddles. And if your can solve all of them, I will let you go.&quot;</p>
<p>My eyes travel to the table filled with fruits and eggs. We should haggle for more than just being allowed to walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;Deal.&quot; Master doesn&#x27;t want to risk it. &quot;I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m quite good at riddles. Shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shoot? Nevermind. Let&#x27;s start with the first riddle... What is my favorite food?&quot;</p>
<p>What kind of riddle is that?! It&#x27;s not a riddle!</p>
<p>Her tentacle arm stretches to the table, grabs a strawberry and pops it in her mouth. &quot;Delicious.&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted that strawberry...</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mind if I check my pokedex?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pokedex? What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A sort of encyclopedia. It contains knowledge over all sorts of pokemon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All sorts, but I bet not me. I&#x27;m special, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s just a Hatterene.</p>
<p>Master pulls out his device, scans her and then it starts talking with a machine&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Hatterene, the silent pokemon, also known as the forest witch. Hatterene knocks out those that intrude in its home forest by blasting them with a beam, then slashing with claws enhanced by psychic power. Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into Hatterene&#x27;s territory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... That thing knows about me?&quot;</p>
<p>She is perplexed and leans forward as if trying to see more of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. It knows about every pokemon, but even without it, I knew most of it from memory. Your species is rather popular, especially in Galar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Popular? For eating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, no. For battling. Fighting together with their trainers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Preposterous. I gave you enough time. What is the answer to my riddle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within - My answer is meat.&quot;</p>
<p>A mocking grin spreads on her face. Master was wrong. It must have been strawberries.</p>
<p>&quot;Correct.&quot; Huh? &quot;I love the taste of flesh. Specifically, human flesh. It&#x27;s so chewy and the way they scream is just a delight for my ears. Oh, I love it so much!&quot;</p>
<p>She moves her tentacle up and down her body. Stroking along her waist and thighs, cupping her breasts before she sticks one of the claws at the end of her tentacle into her wet mouth.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s dripping with saliva. Strings of it connect her rather sharp looking teeth. Her pure black eyes gently close as she must be imagining the taste.</p>
<p>&quot;Their bones are so brittle, their meat is so moist and coppery. I love the fat ones the most.&quot; Her eyes open once more. &quot;Tragedy. You don&#x27;t look very fat at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Master stepped back a little during her speech, and Lopunny took up the space between them.</p>
<p>&quot;Next question! What starts its journey as a truth but ends as a lie?&quot; She takes a seat on the throne and folds her legs on top of each other. Her hair hides everything from view like a very long dress. &quot;Take your time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A story!&quot; Riolu replies excitedly. &quot;It has a kernel of truth, but is made up.&quot; Lopunny nods along.</p>
<p>Each of them are as dumb as they come. Good thing they have me. &quot;Gosssip. The truth becomes distorted to inflict more emotional damage.&quot;</p>
<p>Hatterene rolls her eyes, her black orbs with white, slit irises. &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for the human to respond. I don&#x27;t care about your opinions.&quot;</p>
<p>I want to beat her up. I will use-- Damn it! I lost concentration! Now I need to recharge Toxic again!</p>
<p>Swole begins to mumble. &quot;Some stories are entirely made up or entirely truthful. Gossip might start from a lie... A broken promise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that your final answer?&quot; She leans back as she inspects the trophy by moving it around with her tentacle-arm. She doesn&#x27;t look like she is very interested in his answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Specifically a broken promise. It must start as a truth, but by breaking it, it becomes a lie.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks up again. &quot;Do you know a lot about broken promises, human?&quot; She puts the trophy back on its place and leans forward to put her full attention on us.</p>
<p>&quot;Nnno. No.&quot; He shakes his head and I feel the motion. &quot;I try my best to keep my promises... But sometimes, I promise things I can&#x27;t keep.&quot; He has a far away look on his face as he says this. &quot;Not every promise can be kept, but they must still be promised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Promising safety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>... I get it. Palkia and Dialga could kill us at any moment. There are things we are powerless to predict or prevent.</p>
<p>But he still keeps us safe to the best of his abilities. The way we rescued Lopunny from the avalanche. And his quick thinking to return me to the pokeball.</p>
<p>His best, is really good. And that&#x27;s why I will keep him safe in return. It&#x27;s why I will be ready to hit the nastiest Toxic ever, the moment he tells me to unleash it.</p>
<p>&quot;Final question.&quot; She gets up from her throne. &quot;When I offered you to leave if you get my three riddles right; Did I lie?&quot;</p>
<p>That bitch! She lied, didn&#x27;t she?!</p>
<p><em>Be ready for Toxic</em> I hear his voice in my head and calm down again.</p>
<p>He needs us to provide him with safety.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just one good answer: You told us the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Right. Because if she told the truth, it&#x27;s all three answers correct, and we can leave.</p>
<p>If she lied, then the third response never mattered in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;For what it&#x27;s worth,&quot; she says. Her head hanging low as if in sadness. &quot;I think you would be one of the good ones.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Toxic! Now!</em></p>
<p>&quot;I lied.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny, Fake Out! Riolu, stand by!&quot;</p>
<p>A bright yellow light appears at the tip of her tentacle. She seems unbothered by our counter attack.</p>
<p>I spit out Toxic and the blob flies across the clearing ans hits her torso.</p>
<p>Lopunny almost stumbles. &quot;Master! It failed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fake Out failed?! Try Quick Attack and dodge! Riolu, use Protect!&quot;</p>
<p>I prepare to use Will-O-Wisp. I will wait for his order to release it, just in case he needs it for his planning.</p>
<p>Lopunny stumbles again but turns it into a dodge roll.</p>
<p>Hatterene fires off a massive beam of red hot plasma. Hyper Beam.</p>
<p>It sails past Lopunny and strikes against Riolu&#x27;s shield for almost three seconds. I still feel the heat of that move on my scales.</p>
<p>The attack let&#x27;s up and Riolu&#x27;s Protect pops like a bubble. The shield was completely spent, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if her next Protect would take longer to recharge.</p>
<p>&quot;I get it!&quot; Master shouts out. &quot;It&#x27;s Psychic Terrain! It blocks all priority moves like Fake Out and Quick Attack! Salandit, Will-O-Wisp! Riolu use Ice Beam! Lopunny, use Fling!&quot;</p>
<p>I let the attack escape from my mouth and watch the projectiles float across the battlefield.</p>
<p>But Hatterene does something. Even though she just used Hyper Beam, she is already preparing another move.</p>
<p>A sudden blast of steam discharges from under her hat. It blows up like a smoke screen.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s Misty Terrain.&quot; The steam fills the clearing and smothers and snuffs out Will-O-Wisp, as soon as the orbs touch the mist. &quot;It blocks status effects from being applied.&quot;</p>
<p>Did that cancel Toxic?</p>
<p>Riolu&#x27;s Ice Beam and a random bone Lopunny had picked up from the ground both hit their targets and rip a chunk of damage out of Hatterene.</p>
<p>I try to replace my failed move with Ember as fast as I can - the failure makes it unnecessarily difficult, but I power through it.</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit, use Ember!&quot; I knew he would say that. &quot;Lopunny--&quot;</p>
<p>A claw, powered up with psychic energy sneaked its way through the mist and sliced Lopunny across the face.</p>
<p>A critical hit.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny! Get closer to us! Riolu, track Hatterene for us!&quot;</p>
<p>I see her feelers extend on the other side of his shoulder and her arm extends and points all the way to the other side of the clearing.</p>
<p>The thing still standing in front of us was an illusion! When did she make it?!</p>
<p>I turn my head in the right direction and send a thick stream of embers flying into her general direction. Each projectile rips a tiny hole into her cover and piece by piece reveals her once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny! She tricked you! Attack him! She disguised herself as me!&quot;</p>
<p>WHAT?!</p>
<p>She looks at us for just a moment.</p>
<p>Master has his mouth open in disbelief. &quot;She copied my voice!&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny growls. Her pupils dilate and become pinpricks before her gaze shifts away, back to Hatterene. &quot;I will put you in a world of pain for that trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! I swear! It&#x27;s me! She&#x27;s using illusions to trick you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know my master&#x27;s voice perfectly. You won&#x27;t get me with your cheap imitation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right! Show her, Lopunny, use Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>What?! But that will fail! </p>
<p>No wait! His mouth didn&#x27;t move! It was her again!</p>
<p>&quot;Understood, master.&quot; Lopunny replies and begins to run to Hatterene. Her arms glow in a white color.</p>
<p>&quot;I got it, daddy!&quot; Riolu hops off his shoulder and runs behind Lopunny. Long, metallic claws grow out of her paws. Metal Claw.</p>
<p><em>Stay ready.</em> I hear his voice in my head and understand. He&#x27;s using aura to give out orders now.</p>
<p>Hatterene tries to float away, but my Ember burned such a large hole into her steam cover, that she can&#x27;t escape the punch aimed straight for her jaw.</p>
<p>Critical hit.</p>
<p>Master quickly walks backwards.</p>
<p>No new order.</p>
<p>Then I see it. Hatterene&#x27;s claw drips a viscous black liquid.</p>
<p>Lopunny runs in front of Riolu and uses Protect.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hatterene spins around in a circle and slams her clawed tentacle into Lopunny&#x27;s shield. Her appendage slaps over and over into the shield until she stops and Riolu runs out of cover to strike with Metal Claw.</p>
<p>But Hatterene has already readied the next move. She blasts the clearing with an expanding blast of darkness.</p>
<p>She chained Brutal Swing perfectly into Dark Pulse! The precision, skill and speed! Incredible!</p>
<p><em>Protect</em></p>
<p>Ah! Right! It&#x27;s coming straight for us!</p>
<p>Like a sphere filled with the void, it washes over us and encases us in darkness. Only a thin, shimmering shell of Protect manages to stand in the way of certain doom for Swole.</p>
<p>Once it fades, it reveals a scene of death instead of the beautiful clearing. Gone are the baits and traps, the bed, the throne, the trophy, and the food.</p>
<p>Everything has been replaced by a vast pile of bones.</p>
<p>The ground is nothing but old, brittle bones. They crunch and break like dry twigs as Swole stumbles back in shock.</p>
<p>Only the throne was real. However, instead of gold and silk, it&#x27;s made from bones and sinew. Another piece of furniture stands in front of it. The podium, but made from three thick femora bones, holds up a single human skull.</p>
<p>Is the entire island just the pokemon she killed over what must have been hundreds of years?!</p>
<p><em>Fake Out! Now!</em></p>
<p>The order comes so suddenly, that I&#x27;m almost tempted to ask what and why, but I got more than just the words through aura. I got his intent.</p>
<p>It will work somehow, and so I trust him as I jump from his shoulder and rush head first into danger.</p>
<p>The world around me slows down and the colors change just a little to the red spectrum.</p>
<p>Fake Out is successful and I run across the pile of bones to my target. I place each of my legs carefully to avoid slipping on the uneven surface.</p>
<p>The world slowly zooms past me. I have enough time to think of my next move.</p>
<p>Chaining into Scratch seems to be optimal.</p>
<p>Maybe I should bite her too. I feel like that&#x27;s a good choice, even though I don&#x27;t know Bite.</p>
<p>Is it Poison Fang? Yes, it is!</p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>I smack into Hatterene and the world speeds up to normal tempo once more. </p>
<p>She stumbles just a little after she tried and failed to use another move.</p>
<p>Scratch finds its way across her massive boobs-- Wait, what?!</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just hair and air! She&#x27;s fake! The move parted her grown clothes instead and revealed a much smaller body underneath!</p>
<p>But now that I saw it, Poison Fang strikes true and I hold on to her torso while the move delivers its poison.</p>
<p>Riolu slams her Steel Claw in a spot near my head, and then Lopunny pummels into Hatterene&#x27;s face with a flurry of strikes.</p>
<p><em>Enough!</em></p>
<p>Master shouts in my head and I feel a weightlessness come over me as Hatterene falls with me still on her.</p>
<p>Hatterene falls to the ground and disentangle myself before climbing out of her clothes and back into the open to view the results of our labor.</p>
<p>Hatterene is KO.</p>
<p>Lopunny and Riolu are high-fiving each other and master slumps to the ground in exhaustion.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Wohoo!&quot; Master shouts. His excitement still evident even almost an hour after the fight. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe the Dusk Stone wasn&#x27;t an illusion after all!&quot;</p>
<p>We haven&#x27;t bothered to keep quiet the past few days, I just hope that habit doesn&#x27;t continue once we get out of the salt desert.</p>
<p>&quot;Masster?&quot; Something has been burning on my mind ever since we left Hatterene&#x27;s island behind.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why did we let her live? She tried to kill and eat uss. Instead, you left her food and a potion. Wh iss that?&quot;</p>
<p>Master stays silent for a while. &quot;Lopunny, do you still remember the Stantler of the Bewilder Forest?(capitalization?)&quot;</p>
<p>Stantler? Bewilder Forest? I hate it when someone answers a question with another question.</p>
<p>Lopunny thinks for a moment before nodding. I could really see her needing to concentrate for it. It must have been an event a long time in the past. Long before he caught me, I guess.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think Stantler, and possibly her family that she was going to feed, survived?&quot;</p>
<p>She shrugs. </p>
<p>&quot;Me neither. And I don&#x27;t like that. I know, back then, I didn&#x27;t care if she survived or not, since she attacked us. But it&#x27;s not like she truly had a choice. Ash could have been the meal that made the difference for her offspring, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny shakes her head and I follow suit. I have no idea what he is talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but when I saw Hatteren lying on the ground, KO, emaciated, just skin and bones, I remembered how she talked with us like a human would. We aren&#x27;t so different, pokemon and human, and I know if I fell on hard times I would want a helping hand, even if I made a mistake before.&quot;</p>
<p>I think I get what is going on. She might not be his pokemon, but his aura is so strong, that he develops new bonds easily. Empathy, humans call it, I think. </p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you jusst capture her?&quot;</p>
<p>He waves his hand as if he could dismiss my brilliant suggestion easily. &quot;Too strong and too unpredictable. Trust is paramount, but she is a liar. Besides, she already had a trainer before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator-POV:</strong></p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Eons ago, when the salt flats were still on the surface of the planet, when the Celestica people roamed what would one day become Sinnoh, and even before AZ changed the world by firing the ultimate weapon not just once, but twice.</p>
<p>Such a long time ago, Hatterene was just a tiny, little Hattrem. She traveled together with a human she met. The two of them helped each other escape certain death, and they had been inseparable ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, can&#x27;t we ask them for water?&quot; She asked as their nomadic tribe crossed the salt flats to find greener pastures on the other side.</p>
<p>The sun beat down on them and her trainer was only given enough supplies for a single person. The rest of the tribe traveled around a hundred meters in front of them.</p>
<p>Back then, things didn&#x27;t used to be the same. Pokemon were feared monsters, rightfully so. But every once in a while, a human and pokemon would find each other.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t help with the distrust of others. He became a pyrahya (??) To the rest of his tribe, and they wouldn&#x27;t let him get any closer.</p>
<p>When he asked for water, they would throw stones and send him back.</p>
<p>&quot;I could attack them and take the water from them.&quot; She suggested when she received his last sip of water.</p>
<p>But he refused. He didn&#x27;t want them to be right about her: About the monster he brought into their ranks.</p>
<p>His tribe was nowhere to be seen. As the heat strangled him, his body slowed down.</p>
<p>And so, about a day&#x27;s travel before reaching the end of the salt flats, her master passed out and died shortly after.</p>
<p>Night fell and Hattrem used his cooling corpse for warmth. The sun rose and its rays grew stronger.</p>
<p>Hattrem ate her masters body and drank his blood to survive.</p>
<p>Around a year later, she evolved, feeding herself with the occasional animal and pokemon that stumble so far out into the salt flats.</p>
<p>Another couple of years later, she met the tribe again.</p>
<p>They couldn&#x27;t believe their eyes. A forest? In the middle of the salt flats? </p>
<p>She tricked them in her illusions and slaughtered every single one of them - except one. One person managed to escape to tell the tale:</p>
<p>Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into Hatterene&#x27;s territory.</p>
<p>Another few decades, or perhaps even centuries, later and something took the sky away.</p>
<p>Stuck underground, in the middle of nowhere, she waited for new prey to come around. And it would, every once in a while.</p>
<p>She built her own well, made her own furniture, lives the life she would have wanted for her master.</p>
<p>And now she cries. She ate the food that was left for her, she used the potion too. She didn&#x27;t think humans like that would still exist.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; She wipes away her tears. &quot;Maybe I should move on and find greener pastures. What do you think, master?&quot;</p>
<p>But the skull in front of her can&#x27;t reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? You think I should look for that Galar region? Do you want to come eith me?&quot;</p>
<p>Its empty eye sockets don&#x27;t give her an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to stay... I get it... You like this place. I made it pretty just for you... But I hate it here.&quot;</p>
<p>She gets up from her throne and nods as if hearing something.</p>
<p>&quot;My final order, I understand... Goodbye, master.&quot;</p>
<p>And then she teleports away.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Salandit POV:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Why do we need an alarm to go to bed now?&quot; I ask as Swole pushes the button to blow up the air mattress. We can&#x27;t use the tent because it confines us too much. A predator could sneak up too easily.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, why? It&#x27;s always dark down here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh. Weird. Didn&#x27;t notice.&quot; (Or forgot? )</p>
<p>Everything looks like it always does.</p>
<p>&quot;Night-vision... So jealous.&quot;</p>
<p>Heh. It certainly has its perks. But his flashlight could blind me easily. And there are certain things I don&#x27;t want to see.</p>
<p>Like how Lopunny presses herself against him. </p>
<p>Sigh. I still haven&#x27;t evolved. Even though I have been fighting so much recently... Is something wrong with me? Maybe I should eat more. Mom always ate a lot, I should do that too.</p>
<p>But once I evolve, I can finally compete with her again. That dastardly bunny. Muscles for brains. Has him wrapped around her fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;For my second wish,&quot; Lopunny begins to talk once he finished preparing our camp for the night. &quot;I wish for you to finally give me a proper massage! The type that Salandit got!&quot;</p>
<p>Damn. In just a few weeks, I lost all the progress I had on her. There is no way he will say no.</p>
<p>&quot;G-good grief, are you sure you don&#x27;t want steak instead?&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny growls. &quot;No. I&#x27;m not getting scammed again.&quot; - &quot;I didn&#x27;t scam--&quot; - &quot;Shush. I&#x27;m going to exploit those wishes to their full extent! Now get to it!&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s so horny, it makes her angry. Hangry, I believe I have read online-- I can&#x27;t read. Weird.</p>
<p>&quot;Gooood grief.&quot; He pulls out Lopunny&#x27;s grooming supplies. &quot;Alright. You win.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I could intervene, but Lopunny would actually beat me up.</p>
<p>I bet he&#x27;s just as horny... </p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>Arceus, she really picked a bad time for this. Dawn, Zoey, Lopunny and Salandit have been teasing me for weeks.</p>
<p>I almost <em>want</em> to do this.</p>
<p>She lies down on her stomach and displays her butt and thighs in the process. Her bunny tail wags teasingly and her long ears frame her body while giving access to everything.</p>
<p>~&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; </p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want her to flip out like that one time.</p>
<p>I squirt out a lot of the massage lotion across her back and put some more in my hands. It&#x27;s cool and slippery.</p>
<p>&quot;I bet you wished it was something warm and slippery on your back instead, huh?&quot; I can&#x27;t help but tease her.</p>
<p>But it seems to fall on unappreciating ears until Salandit whispers and explanation to her, at which point her legs tense up and her ears twitch.</p>
<p>I start the massage with her legs. Her thighs. Seemingly the largest pair of muscles on her body, but that&#x27;s actually still her gluteus maximus. Her anatomy isn&#x27;t that different from a human&#x27;s. </p>
<p>I take care of her left thigh first. When I rub on the outside, it feels as if I&#x27;m touching solid steel wrapped in a thin layer of fat, skin and fur.</p>
<p>She moans from my first touch. Anticipation is probably pleasing her more than my hands are at this point.</p>
<p>~&quot;Higher.&quot; She demands when I swap to the inside of her legs. Initially, it&#x27;s softer, but as I press deeper, I feel the individual muscles on her leg. She is quite tense and she really needs the massage.</p>
<p>She worked so much in the past days. Her muscles need a break.</p>
<p>~&quot;Higher!&quot; She complains a little louder.</p>
<p>I go lower instead and take care of her calves. First comes the work for her physical benefit... Then the... fun for her reward.</p>
<p>One of her ears tries to slap me, but I&#x27;m out of range.</p>
<p>When I move even lower, I come to a halt. Her feet are not human. She basically always stands on the tips of her feet and she has paw pads.</p>
<p>~&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare stop!&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to get the anatomy book for reference...</p>
<p>My hands watlder to what would be the heel of her foot. It&#x27;s bony and I can feel some taut sinew below her skin.</p>
<p>I trace the sinew down with my fingers until I reach the large paw pad. Lopunny makes a sound once I touch it.</p>
<p>&quot;Did that hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;No! Keep going.&quot;</p>
<p>I rub her paw. The spaces between her toes, the fur between her paw pads and the leathery, but soft, pads themselves.</p>
<p>~&quot;Hnnng, that feels sooo good.&quot;</p>
<p>Her moaning increases, but it sounds a little less sexual than before. She probably just needed a massage for her weary feet. She and I are the only ones who need to walk, after all.</p>
<p>I repeat the process with her other foot before I move on to her upper body.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t hold back. I straddle her from behind and practically sit on her thighs.</p>
<p>~&quot;How is your throne?&quot;</p>
<p>... I can&#x27;t answer that.</p>
<p>Instead I lean forward a little, readjust when I notice my junk touching her butt, and then I give her shoulders and neck a good rub.</p>
<p>Here too, does she feel tense and I can spot a couple of knots in her muscles that I apply pressure on to fix. </p>
<p>Then I massage her arms, her back, her sides and finally, her a--</p>
<p>No, wait. I can&#x27;t move on to her ass just yet. Instead, I take her left ear in my hand and feel it twitch immediately. Like a lightning bolt running through her body, a shudder forms at the spot that I grabbed and travels all the way down to her feet.</p>
<p>She moves one of her hands towards her face.</p>
<p>From the top of her ear, I gently run my hands down, kneading, pushing and massaging the weird appendage at the same time.</p>
<p>It almost feels like a fur-covered, thick tounge. It might be exactly that. Just a flexible muscle, hidden by fur and fluff.</p>
<p>But seeing her squirm underneath me, does give me a rather brilliant idea.</p>
<p>I lean further down. Pressing myself against her butt until I feel her tail wagging against my stomach, and then I bite her ear.</p>
<p>A little harsher than I wanted.</p>
<p>She shudders and squeals.</p>
<p>Now, I can finally dig my hands into her a--</p>
<p>~&quot;She finished already.&quot; Salandit says and distracts me.</p>
<p>&quot;... What?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;She wished to get the ssame treatment I did. And she finished already. Her wish iss over. I bet she wanted to trick you by stifling her moans in the end, but she can&#x27;t trick me. Hiss hiss hiss.&quot;</p>
<p>Right... I take one last look at her butt. And my mind paints a picture of her chest... I&#x27;m missing out.</p>
<p>But I stand up. A deal is a deal.</p>
<p>~&quot;Nooo! Huff huff. You lizardly bitch! Pant. I&#x27;ll get you for that!&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s knackered, lies flat on her stomach... A few more breaths and I think she will fall asleep.</p>
<p>... Not a single brush in sight... Good grief. What am I gonna do now? Just tough it out again?</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief--... No. Fuck it. Sigh.&quot; I needed a proper sigh for that. &quot;Scoot over, Lopunny.&quot;</p>
<p>She hogs the entire mattress and only gives me the scraps to sleep on. Once I lie down, she puts herself over me. Her arm on my chest, her body on my arm, her head into the crook of my neck... Not even Dawn is so clingy when we sleep.</p>
<p>I push the both of us closer to the middle of the mattress so we won&#x27;t fall off at night. &quot;Good night.&quot;</p>
<p>I close my eyes. I don&#x27;t reopen them when I feel Lopunny shift her body, or when Salandit and Riolu lie down on my other side, or when Lopunny lovingly kisses my lips.</p>
<p>~&quot;Good night, master.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Sssleep tight.&quot; My pants are indeed tight.</p>
<p>~&quot;G-d nite.&quot; Riolu is barely awake.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you taking care of first guard duty, Salandit? I don&#x27;t think the others are in great shape anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>She grumbles something, but aura allows me to understandit anyway. ~&quot;But then I can&#x27;t dig through your backpack.&quot;</p>
<p>That makes me open my eyes to look at her. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you use my backpack. You can use it anytime.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;It doesn&#x27;t work when someone lookss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won&#x27;t look. In fact, I close my eyes and try to sleep. I&#x27;m really tired.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Good night, masster. You&#x27;re the besst.&quot; She whispers the last part, but I still hear it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Then she whispers even quieter. ~&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too.&quot;</p>
<p>I half expect Lopunny and Riolu tush to tell me they love me too, but they fell asleep already.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re all the greatest pokemon a man could ever hope for.&quot;</p>
