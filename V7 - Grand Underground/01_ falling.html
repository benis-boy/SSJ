<p>Highly detailed. Make it feel like it takes forever.</p>
Sounds of wind and rocks
Pure panic as he tries to recall Lopunny over and over again, pure luck allows it.
She immediately breaks out again, preparing to protect her human.
They see the water of a river below. As luck would have it, they are aiming for it.
MC recalls salandit to avoid the water.
Riolu refuses to be returned and insists she can swim and help.
Impact with water ends the scene
<p>1.2 finding themselves </p>
MC wakes up with exhausted and battered Lopunny and Riolu sleeping on him.
Wakes up at edge of dried up river bed.
Very Salty Ocean nearby, they can only smell it.
Caring for L while she sleeps.
Not daring to leave them.
Explores what he can and ponders how to get up again.
Eternal night underground. Glowing crystals seem like stars. Some crystal pillars 
The girls wake up and look for him for leadership.
He suggests waiting for help.
Mesprit tells them to move north instead and the act like it&#x27;s their choice.
<p>1.3 relaxing at beach</p>
They walk over a single hill and see the edge of an ocean right behind it.
MC needs a break from the surreality.
After checking for threats, they make camp and prepare steaks as well as pellets for the travels.
Set up Lopunny as a legitimate threat to MCs virginity. She keeps escalating things.
Even forcing MC to give French kiss before bed 
<p>1.4 beginning their journey. (Narrator)</p>
They walk north, along the edge of the ocean.
Until the soil crunches under their feet.
The land has become salt flats and they must leave the ocean behind in order to continue traveling north.
They restock as much water as they can and begin their travel into the salt flats.
For 3 days and nights.
Nothing but salt the whole time.
<p>2. Siren</p>
<p>2.1 siren&#x27;s calls</p>
For the first time in days, a change of scenery.
Tiny island in the ocean of salt.
Dead trees.
A well.
A market shelve filled with all sorts of drinks.
A lavishly filled table, steaks on every plate.
A podium with a trophy.
Another with an evolution stone
It&#x27;s obviously a trap.
After lots of arguing (Lopunny is for it, Salandit against, Riolu defers to MC);
They check out which of the things are real, only finding the well actually exists.
MC thinks if this is a group hallucinations, while he throws down the bucket to get water.
&quot;You want my water?&quot;
Hatterene shows herself.
<p>2.2 Siren&#x27;s Riddle</p>
She likes to play with her food.
She pretends that she is greatly offended for MC wanting to steal from her.
MC is naive and thinks she can be reasoned with, like Lucario.
He figures out along her riddles that she is a man eater and they need to gtfo.
Survives a sudden hit thanks to aura.
She interrupts him giving orders to his team.
<p>2.3 Battle versus Hatterene </p>
Starts by fleeing from her.
She is overwhelmingly strong in a 1v1.
Teamwork still wins it, barely.
Riolu and Salandit get KOed.
Lopunny wins.
Contemplate executing her -&gt; does not do it, for it is in her nature to act like that.
Her illusions have all disappeared and the evolution stone and the well are still there.
With loot and restocked water, they continue their travels.
<p>3. Scylla and Charybdis </p>
<p>3.1 Dracovish</p>
Scenery change. River landscape.
They see him relaxing in the sun. Menacingly.
Once he notices them, he stops snoring, waddles into the water and creates whirlpools.
As if he wants to stop them from continuing forward.
&quot;Wtf is that pokemons problem&quot;
But instead of fighting, or crossing the stream, they head upstream.
<p>3.2 Hydragon </p>
Describe meadows in Niederlanden
Edge of cave in the far distance
River collects itself here from a lot of streams that are easily passable.
It looks too peaceful.
As soon as the group steps inside the meadow, a shadow swoops out of a barely hidden cave.
Hydragon - willing to let them pass for a price. 3, no 6 of his companions. The heads are smart, aggressive and retarded.
First makes suggestions, second agrees and turns them into demands, third says &quot;Yes! YES! Hihihue.&quot;
Always.
MC haggles them down to 6 steaks instead.
<p>3.3 Temple</p>
They continue north and reach the smooth cave wall
In front of it is a temple.
Greek design.
Elaborate designs and mechanisms.
Clearly much more advanced than our Greek.
Depictions of gods including Palkia and Dialga fighting each other.
&gt;this was a pokeball
Salandit activates the trap mechanism and traps them all inside.
<p>4. escape</p>
<p>4.1 life as trapped people</p>
Show their attempts to escape.
MC is first to give up -&gt; it&#x27;s designed to capture Gods. They won&#x27;t be able to escape.
Salandit and Riolu follow his sentiment.
Lopunny tries a few more times.
Once they give up, they ask themselves what now.
Boredom sets in.
Show a few moments of boredom. Like bouncing a ball against the wall. Polishing badges and pokeballs.
Lopunny looks at MC with increasingly much lust.
<p>4.2 Lopunny breaks</p>
Rape scene.
<p>4.3 aftercare and Tyrunt </p>
Lopunny does not regret it. But she still cares for him.
MC stays silent.
The pokemon talk about it as if it was natural.
MC does subtle things, like moving his face away, not trying to touch her, etc.
But their noise attracted a visitor.
Tyrunt appeared. They try their best to talk with him, but he can&#x27;t speak.
He can understand though. And he is fearful enough of his opponents so he doesn&#x27;t start any trouble.
Eventually they tell him, show us where you came from.
<p>4.4 Cave maze</p>
It&#x27;s a small hole in the ground
At the very edge of the temple, it&#x27;s a sharp cut and behind it is a cave.
A vast cavesystem with small canyons, crevices, and dripstone caves. All connected with tunnels.
Inside are large quantities of animalistic, prehistoric pokemon.
Tyrunt leads them up past most territories - he is a careless and curious fellow. He learned to stay out of other pokemon&#x27;s territories the hard way.
Show the different sceneries as if the group walks through them. Focus on motions.
Wading through streams, climbing up walls, jumping across canyons. Streams in forest, walls in alpine region, canyon in mesa
=&gt; areas don&#x27;t make any sense
<p>5. Haunted house</p>
<p>5.1 Emergence</p>
They climb out of a tiny, unassuming hole in the ground and enter wilderness territory.
