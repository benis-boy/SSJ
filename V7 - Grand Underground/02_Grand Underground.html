<p>There are trees far below me that look like tiny shrubbery. The wind rushes past my ears and creates a deafening noise. Like rolling thunder, the rock slide is the only sound piercing through the wind curtain.</p>
<p>My outstretched arm already holds the pearly white premier ball. One flash of red lightning after another shoots out of it and bashes uselessly against the wall of falling rocks. My vision is blurry. It&#x27;s not working.</p>
<p>Lopunny is still in there!</p>
<p>I keep trying to recall her, but it&#x27;s impossible. I just need a fraction of her body to be visible, but it&#x27;s not happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Riolu! Use Aura Sphere! Salandit, use Mud-Slap!&quot;</p>
<p>Everything is happening so slowly. I can almost see the red beam traveling through the air. A few smaller rocks are falling equally slowly through the air. Riolu and Salandit sluggishly prepare their moves.</p>
<p>They are so slow! Why are they so slow?!</p>
<p>We keep falling. It&#x27;s still hundreds of meters down.</p>
<p>After many minutes of me uselessly trying to recall Lopunny, Mud-Slap and Aura Sphere began to move through the air.</p>
<p>Fighting type and ground type are both strong against rocks... Oh, Arceus, please work.</p>
<p>The pokeball works overtime, trying to find Lopunny with its light beam but only bouncing off the rocks before it fizzles out and disappears every time.</p>
<p>&quot;Attack again!&quot; The projectiles are about to hit the avalanche of rocks. I can only hope they can blow a hole into the curtain, and the pokeball will connect. If it doesn&#x27;t work, we&#x27;ll have to try again.</p>
<p>The moves hit the target with explosive force, the blast ringing in my ears for a while. The rock fragments and shards fly all over the place in slow motion.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s my perception of time that has slowed down.</p>
<p>Time dilation. An effect of adrenaline, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>It allows me to see each nearby boulder as it falls, to predict its movements, and to spot Lopunny&#x27;s foot for just a second before another massive rock would fall into place and blocks the line of sight again. It gives me just enough time to activate the recall function of the pokeball in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>I can see the beam shooting out, the boulder falling slightly faster than Lopunny, and the dust trying to obscure her again. Despite my vision failing at the edges of my view, I can see it all.</p>
<p>But I lose sight of her foot. The boulder fell between us.</p>
<p>However, this time the beam of light did not simply disappear into thin air! Instead, it pulls back as if reeling in a blob of energy.</p>
<p>Lopunny was successfully returned!</p>
<p>And she broke out a moment later.</p>
<p>She appears next to me in all of her hazelnut colored glory.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny!&quot; I scream as loud as I can to be heard over the rushing winds.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s back! She won&#x27;t be buried alive under hundreds of tonnes of rock!</p>
<p>~&quot;Maaaster!&quot;</p>
<p>And then she seemingly flies up and away.</p>
<p>Our velocity is much greater than hers, so it appears as if she&#x27;s flying away.</p>
<p>Fun fact, velocity is defined as a vector. Meaning, it has a specific power, origin and direction at the moment of measurement.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d estimate that my current velocity is around 50 meter per second. From my current position as origin. Aimed towards the ground...</p>
<p>Aimed towards the ground!?</p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll hit the ground in around 5 seconds, after accounting for acceleration!</p>
<p>Rapidly growing trees litter the sides of a large river that is directly underneath us. We&#x27;re going to splash in there.</p>
<p>Falls aren&#x27;t deadly, but drowning is. Can falls still know me out?</p>
<p>I clip Lopunny&#x27;s pokeball back into my belt and press the button on the other two balls to recall Salandit and Riolu.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny!--&quot; Riolu popped back out of her ball and zooms up as well. &quot;I need you to save me, Lopunny! And Riolu, stay inside your ball!&quot;</p>
<p>I press her button again and brace for impact.</p>
<p>Two seconds left...</p>
<p>That&#x27;s going to hurt.</p>
<p>The ground is closing in so quickly.</p>
<p>Are they sure falls aren&#x27;t deadly any more?</p>
<p>One...</p>
<p>That doesn&#x27;t look like a very deep river. And the low light makes it look spooky.</p>
<p>I wonder what being knocked out feels like.</p>
<p>Riolu pops out again.</p>
<p>~&quot;I can--&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Wha-&quot;</p>
<p>Fffuck me. Everything hurts. What the hell happened?</p>
<p>I had just finished fighting Dugtrio and his family... then... the ground fell apart? No way. I fell down.</p>
<p>That can&#x27;t be.</p>
<p>I was in the tunnels. I know that! But then why is the star-covered sky above me?!</p>
<p>No, wait. Those aren&#x27;t stars. They are far too large to be stars. And the moon is missing.</p>
<p>Some kinds of pillars reach up from the ground to the <em>sky</em> in the distance. None of these pillars are nearby, so I can&#x27;t make out any details. But they glow in the same light blue colors as the <em>stars</em>.</p>
<p>I feel like I have seen some of that before.</p>
<p>Lopunny&#x27;s rhythmic breathing keeps me calm and collected as I take in the sights. Riolu has her head resting on my arm and Lopunny sleeps face-down on my chest. Her ears and torso are doing a great job as a blanket.</p>
<p>Salandit is-- Where is she? &quot;Salandit?&quot;</p>
<p>My brain feels foggy. My vision lags and blurs. When I turn my head to look for the familiar purple of Salandit&#x27;s glowing eyes, I can only see darkness and the motion lines that the stars leave behind them.</p>
<p>Only when I keep my head still for a moment can I see. I check left, right - see my backpack, carelessly thrown on the ground - and down. Salandit isn&#x27;t around.</p>
<p>This is worse than the next mornings after I get drunk.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny? Have you seen Salandit?&quot; No response. She doesn&#x27;t react when I move my hand through the fur on her head and ears either. She has been knocked out cold.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure I fell down, I just can&#x27;t recall any details.</p>
<p>Did Salandit fall down nearby?</p>
<p>The area looks weird. A couple of trees. It looks as if I&#x27;m at the beach of a dried up river.</p>
<p>The trees look weird. Alien almost. The leaves are deep black in the low light of this... underworld.</p>
<p>The sky is a cave&#x27;s ceiling. The stars must be crystals, like the ones I saw at the tree of beginning. It all reminds me a little of the conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>What was it? &#x27;Hollow earth&#x27;? &#x27;Grand underground&#x27;?</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m stuck. My head hurts. I don&#x27;t know where I am. It sound like my survival professor at pokemon school was right to teach us the basics.</p>
<p>First things first.</p>
<p>Check myself for wounds. My head hurts but I don&#x27;t feel bumps or bleeding. The rest of my body feels alright. Exhausted, but not hurt. Perhaps a minor concussion, but I don&#x27;t feel sick or nauseous.</p>
<p>Lopunny seems fine too. Her fur looks dispelled but there are no open wounds or broken bones, as far as I could tell after removing her from me and giving her an examination.</p>
<p>Riolu seems to be knocked out from exhaustion as well. Her breathing is steady and her body doesn&#x27;t feel broken either. Again, only her fur is a mess.</p>
<p>Neither of them react to my touching. Heavy exhaustion.</p>
<p>Salandit is... still missing!</p>
<p>Where is she?!</p>
<p>I fell into a river, right? Salandit can&#x27;t swim; I bet I recalled her!</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit, come out.&quot; I press the button on her black and golden luxury ball.</p>
<p>And as luck would have it, a beam shoots out, and she appears, shaking like a leaf, eyes closed and body tense.</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;M-masster? D-did we drown?&quot; Her eyes are still closed while her head tracked the source of my voice.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Salandit. We didn&#x27;t drown. Now open your eyes and come here.&quot;</p>
<p>She opens her eyes and takes in the strange sights. The same way I did, her eyes first look at the stars, at the distant pillars, the weird trees, and finally at the dried up river. She spits in its direction before approaching me slowly.</p>
<p>Too slowly. So I move closer and pick her up instead.</p>
<p>I cuddle her for a moment, which she likes, before letting her go and picking up my backpack. She didn&#x27;t like being let go and scaled up my body instead.</p>
<p>~&quot;What happened with them?&quot;</p>
<p>She asks as I pull out two potions from my backpack and add it to the potion from my pants pocket.</p>
<p>If I fell all the way down from way up there at the ceiling, then it&#x27;s a wonder the bottle survived the fall.</p>
<p>With one arm, I reach up to my shoulder and pick Salandit up again before giving her whole body a few spurts of potion.</p>
<p>She struggles against the painful stinging sensation of the potion but calms down once I&#x27;m done.</p>
<p>&quot;They are out with exhaustion. Lopunny saved us in the river and Riolu saved my backpack, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Hiss hiss. Once again she got KOed and I am sstill standing. Aren&#x27;t I great-- Ouch!&quot;</p>
<p>I flicked her snout. &quot;Now is not the time for that sort of joke. Can you check for enemies?&quot;</p>
<p>She pokes her tongue out at me.</p>
<p>~&quot;Nothing around. Dead fish, salty air and rotting plants.&quot;</p>
<p>I sniff at the air myself.</p>
<p>It does smell a little like at a fish vendor&#x27;s place. The plants are probably algae and other river vegetation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to see much from this location. Small hills surround us. Beyond that is darkness and what appears to be a starry night.</p>
<p>The ground is soft, but dirty. Sand tends to be dirty.</p>
<p>Which is why I dig out the tent&#x27;s air mattress and roll Lopunny on top of it. Riolu too.</p>
<p>&quot;Still no enemies around?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;None.&quot;</p>
<p>In that case, I pull out the girls&#x27; grooming supplies.</p>
<p>Might as well make myself useful and clean up their fur while we wait. Once they are awake, we can search for sources of water.</p>
<p>Lopunny let&#x27;s out a light purr when I brush over her ears. I leave the fluffy tips of her ears for last, since the fluff requires a different type of brush.</p>
<p>Her fur quickly becomes presentable again, but more importantly, it becomes softer. When her fur dries without any special care, it bunches together and becomes stiff.</p>
<p>Her back, stomach, legs, arms, qnd even thighs are all easily handled. I only stop at her chest and gluteus maximus.</p>
<p>They look like the ass and tits of a human. Just covered in fur instead of clothes.</p>
<p>I wonder...</p>
<p>~&quot;You sshould feel them.&quot;</p>
<p>The ever present devil on my shoulder whispers in my ears with her usual snake lisp.</p>
<p>She is right though. Lopunny is asleep. I would never get the chance again to check if it feels the same too, without her knowing what I did.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. Salandit has really managed to wear down my mental resistance.</p>
<p>Her chest rises and falls with her steady breathing. She must have a pleasant dream, considering the slight smirk on her face.</p>
<p>Does that count as rape? No, right? Rape only works with penetration. So sexual assault?</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s just a kind of medical examination.</p>
<p>Right. I&#x27;m getting a baseline feeling, in case something happens in the future.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a pervert who is weirdly attracted to their pokemon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like I can barely keep my eyes off of her supple breasts, an ass so tight, I could bounce a coin on it, wide, childbearing hips or thicc thighs.</p>
<p>... Good grief. I have a problem.</p>
<p>My hand already hovers over her chest, I didn&#x27;t even notice it move.</p>
<p>~&quot;Do it.&quot;</p>
<p>I lower my hand the rest of the way. A conscious decision... I am so cooked.</p>
<p>It feels nice. So soft, and the fuzzy texture of her fur only adds to the softness. My hand practically sinks into the flesh of her breast.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t choke (check if repeated slang) my snake in such a long time and I&#x27;m really feeling it now.</p>
<p>My pants grow tighter as I squeeze my hand around her miniature mound. She fits perfectly in my grasp. Almost as if it was meant to be.</p>
<p>Near the center of my palm I can feel a nub through her fur. I wonder, are pokemon closer to mammals or reptiles?</p>
<p>They clearly have mammary glands. But they lay eggs. Maybe they are more like platypus or echidnas. Monotremes, I believe they are called.</p>
<p>No matter what they are, her bosom feels nice and symmetrical. She doesn&#x27;t have any scars left either. Truly, a perfect body.</p>
<p>Her face looks rather cute too. Barely a hint of human features, but her button nose, tiniest whiskers, and her large expressive purple eyes are all rather cute in their own way.</p>
<p>Her whiskers vibrate a little with her purs. They can barely be seen otherwise, but I&#x27;m close enough to spot them.</p>
<p>The tiny nostrils of her button nose expand and contract quickly, as if taking in the surrounding scents.</p>
<p>Her pupils have dilated and they show the excitement she feels clearly. The black sclera sche has instead of the human-white makes her almost look like a sort of demonic figure from the foreign religions and myths. Like a succubus.</p>
<p>Her mouth opens slightly. She must be dreaming of something that involved using her mouth and my horny brain jumps to the first conclusion.</p>
<p>They say that a near-death experience makes someone aroused, and they really weren&#x27;t kidding.</p>
<p>~&quot;Hi, master.&quot; Her voice is husky and laced with obvious seductive intent.</p>
<p>A weaker man might fall to temptation right then and there, but someone like me, that person is just too startled from the realization that Lopunny woke up already.</p>
<p>An ice cold shiver runs down my spine as her furry hand grasps mine and keeps it in place.</p>
<p>&quot;H-hi, Lopunny. How are you doing? Do you feel pain anywhere?&quot; I try to pull my hand away but her hold is too strong. My arm can&#x27;t move an inch.</p>
<p>Her ears twitch. Her eyes quickly dart all over our immediate surroundings. She rubs my hand along her chest and I feel the nub of her nipple stiffening slightly.</p>
<p>~&quot;Salandit?&quot; She addresses her teammate. ~&quot;Enemies?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;No-- Yes. Lots. I ssmelled a few nearby but they didn&#x27;t dare to approach.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Tsk.&quot; A dangerous and annoyed look flitters across Lopunny&#x27;s face. ~&quot;Next time, then.&quot;</p>
<p>... G-good grief!</p>
<p>She lets go of my hand and stands up before giving me a hug. ~&quot;Good morning, master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s afternoon. We&#x27;re in a cave.&quot; I used my phone to check the time. As long as it doesn&#x27;t descncronize, this will be our only reliable way to track the time down here.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re going to stay here until Riolu wakes up as well--&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I&#x27;m awake.&quot; She pipes up. Still lying on the air mattress after Lopunny left it for her alone to use.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, I will fix up your fur too and then we can look for the hole we came out of.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Your mom. Hiss hiss hiss.&quot;</p>
<p>I ignore Salandit. Instead I grab Lopunny&#x27;s brush again and start giving Riolu the luxury treatment as well.</p>
<p>I put her on my lap and begin my combing through the fur on her head.</p>
<p>Her tail wags excitedly until it suddenly stop. Then she wiggles around, looks over her shoulder and grins. ~&quot;What is that, daddy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s- uhhh, it&#x27;s--&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Oh! It&#x27;s your penis!&quot; Who taught her that word?! ~&quot;The thing you can make hatchlings with!&quot;</p>
<p>If I had something to drink, I would have done a literal spit-take. As things currently are, all I could do was choke on my saliva.</p>
<p>My eyes look for the responsible lizard who is laughing her ass off. Hiss hiss hiss, she says over and over like a wheezing snake.</p>
<p>~&quot;You know,&quot; Riolu continues. ~&quot;Hot, sweaty, steamy sex. That&#x27;s how hatchlings are made.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit! You&#x27;re in big trouble now!&quot;</p>
<p>That finally manages to shut her laughter up. ~&quot;Wha-- What did I do?!&quot;</p>
<p>Riolu rubs herself against me some more-- No, wait. She&#x27;s suppressing laughter!</p>
<p>I flick the back of her head and give her the meanest look when she turns around again.</p>
<p>~&quot;Hehe.&quot; She laughs sheepishly. ~&quot;I&#x27;m older than you think, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>Ah! ... I forgot. Or rather, I didn&#x27;t think about it. She is partly Lucario, who... carried an egg... fathered by a human.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s weird. I should stop thinking about it again.</p>
<p>I quickly unbother myself by thinking of pictures of Captain Braviary, Roark and his brother Byron, as well as old man Mr. Gump naked together.</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
<p>Instantly shriveled up.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s finish your grooming. And stop learning your humor from Salandit.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>~&quot;What now, daddy?&quot; Riolu looks up at me from my lap. Her fur is properly groomed once more and she enjoys a bit more petting before we leave.</p>
<p>&quot;We will need to walk upstream to find the hole in the ceiling we fell out of. Once there, we can wait for the rescue team to finish clearing out the tunnels; And then most likely they will head down here to investigate.&quot;</p>
<p>Solana comes to my mind as the most likely first responder. &quot;We will probably get a ride back up on top of Charizard&#x27;s back.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Hmh. Makes sense.&quot; Riolu hums.</p>
<p>~&quot;What did you expect?&quot; Salandit asks her. ~&quot;He&#x27;ss <em>our</em> master, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;True. He really is the best in decision making.&quot;</p>
<p><em>You need to head north instead.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Actually, maybe waiting for help isn&#x27;t the best choice. We miss out on potential profits and adventures if we don&#x27;t head north. I think we should go north.&quot;</p>
<p>All my pokemon look at me in confusion as if they don&#x27;t know what came over me, until a feeling of clarity and understanding washes over them.</p>
<p>~&quot;You&#x27;re right master.&quot; Lopunny pulls herself against my arm as she says it. ~&quot;North sounds a lot better.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;What did you expect? Of course north ssounds better. He came up with it, after all.&quot; Salandit nods as if she&#x27;s giving out sage wisdom.</p>
<p>Riolu doesn&#x27;t look quite convinced. ~&quot;Did something just happen? Why are you all agreeing--&quot; Her face takes on a serene smile as if a sense of certainty and understanding washed over her. ~&quot;Of course. Let&#x27;s head north. The only sensible direction.&quot;</p>
<p>The mission is clear and everyone agrees. We&#x27;re heading north.</p>
<p>On the way, we will look for a supply of water. Enough food for a long time should be in my supplies and even shelter is already taken care of with the tent. I already took treated every wound we had and everyone is fit and back on their legs.</p>
<p>Just minor exhaustion remains, but I will decide whether that&#x27;s a reason to take a longer break after cresting the first hill.</p>
<p>&quot;So.&quot; I slap my legs, get up, and check the compass. &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot;</p>
<p>And thus we march up the hill.</p>
<p>Lopunny walks close to me, her arms wrapped themselves around my right arm, Salandit took up the good spot on my right shoulder and Riolu the bad spot on my left.</p>
<p>Like a mobile fortress, covered in deadly pokemon, I make my way up.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>The hill ends with an ocean on the other side.</p>
<p>Low, small waves crash against the shore at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>The dark ocean reflects the lights of the stars and pillars. Like an endless expanse of lights. What a beautiful place.</p>
<p>We could continue further north by walking along the beach.</p>
<p>Or we could wait here just a little longer.</p>
<p>I could use a break. I feel like I&#x27;m still detached from the surrealism happening all around me.</p>
<p>Like, for real.</p>
<p>I set up our camp for cooking and sleeping.</p>
<p>Like, what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>I just wanted some extra money, and this is what it turned into. I&#x27;m basically stuck in another world.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s really the best description for this place. It&#x27;s a cave, but I can&#x27;t see the walls of the cavern, and the ceiling is as vast as the sky outside.</p>
<p>There are no clouds at least. A marvelous sight of jewels sparkling in the darkness, and it&#x27;s not even nighttime.</p>
<p>I wonder how it will look like then? Not any different from now, perhaps? Or complete darkness? If so, ghost pokemon might be a serious threat.</p>
<p>I pull off my boots and socks. My toes sink into loose beach sand. It looks the same as regular sand.</p>
<p>Everything here looks so normal, yet extraordinary at the same time. Trees, but they are weird. An ocean, but it&#x27;s a dark abyss with sparkling lights. Loose sand, but what?</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the thing with the beach?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s sus, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Various forms of affirmatives come back to me.</p>
<p>Only Riolu&#x27;s affirmation sounded a lot like &#x27;what is a sus?&#x27;, but I take what I can get.</p>
<p>The sand seems normal enough, so I continue preparing for dinner. We had a long and arduous adventure behind us with the tunnels and the directly preceeding gym battle.</p>
<p>We deserve a hearty meal and a good break of it all.</p>
<p>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you agree, Lopunny?&quot;</p>
<p>She can feel enough through our bond to get a general understanding of what I meant.</p>
<p>~&quot;You mean it&#x27;s steak for dinner!?&quot;</p>
<p>The excitable parts of her personality remained despite the evolution.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Today, we&#x27;re having steak.&quot;</p>
<p>However, instead of cute, it makes her... erotic. The way she presses herself against me while looking at me with those wide eyes. The way her boobs squish against my arms.</p>
<p>Dawn and Zoey have never begged me for anything this way.</p>
<p>They pressed my arm between their breasts instead. A show of ownership. I am their man.</p>
<p>This is different. Another, different form of ownership. She literally throws herself at me. She desired to be owned by me. </p>
<p>I already wanted to prepare steaks, still she begs me like this.</p>
<p>I could tell her no. I have the power to deny her.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, let&#x27;s make salad instead. I&#x27;m hungry for some salad.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a rush.</p>
<p>The way she deflates, before pulling herself up my arm again, to get closer to my face. ~&quot;Pleaaase!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm... but I&#x27;m yearning for a salad...&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Nooo! Please make steak!&quot;</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not even sure how serious she is being, and how much she is just playing along, but I like it either way.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. We&#x27;re having steak for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Yay!&quot;</p>
<p>So easy. Not even Riolu is that oblivious.</p>
<p>But I still per her head and ears to extend her moment of bliss for a while longer. She likes this, and that&#x27;s all that matters.</p>
<p>And I like it as well. Both her reactions, as well as her behavior. The innate behavior of a pokemon to follow their trainer&#x27;s orders.</p>
<p>Such a curious thing. As if trainers and pokemon were meant to be working together like that.</p>
<p>The steaks sear in the pans and their aromas waft into our noses. </p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t get the chance to cook while in the tunnels.</p>
<p>For quite a lot of days now, Dawn and Zoey were cooking for me too. I was only taking care of frying then.</p>
<p>As I prepare an egg salad as a side dish, I can&#x27;t help but think of this as almost a sort of vacation.</p>
<p>A beautiful beach, just me and my pokemon. No enemies around as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>Did I lose sight of what it means to be a pokemon trainer?</p>
<p>All I did was training and going on dates.</p>
<p>When was the last time I did something nice for my pokemon?</p>
<p>I groomed them, but that&#x27;s because I want them to be presentable.</p>
<p>I gave them rewards for their performances.</p>
<p>... Did I ever just do them a favor? Or is this just the concussion talking right now?</p>
<p>As I put down the cutlery and plates for everyone, I can&#x27;t help but wonder what my pokemon even want.</p>
<p>Outside of rewards and training, is there something I could give them?</p>
<p>&quot;Is there something you girls want?&quot; In the end, I just ask them plainly. &quot;In general, I mean. Not as rewards.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I want to be stronger!&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I want to lay ssso many eggs, my mom would become jealous.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I don&#x27;t desire anything.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot to unpack. Lopunny is already on her way to be stronger.</p>
<p>Salandit is joking.</p>
<p>And Riolu... I&#x27;m at fault. She is not her own pokemon. I will need to find some purpose for her.</p>
<p>In the end, the ability to talk with pokemon does not magically give me the ability to truly understand them.</p>
<p>I swallow the final piece of my steak. I was the slowest, in the end. Too distracted. It was delicious though.</p>
<p>&quot;How about we just cuddle before bed?&quot;</p>
<p>They always sleep on top of me, but we rarely have the time to just enjoy the moments before or after sleep.</p>
<p>And now, water available, food supply steady, shelter secured, wounds treated.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re stuck in a cavern until we find a way out, or until a rescue team finds us.</p>
<p>... There is nothing standing in the way for us to simply relax.</p>
<p>I let out a deep sigh into Lopunny&#x27;s fur near her neck. I don&#x27;t even bother to replace it with my usual &#x27;good grief&#x27;-catchphrase.</p>
<p>Taking a break from the surrealism, huh? What an apt description, as we lie down on a white sand beach of a dark world that is surrounded by stars in all directions.</p>
<p>Truly a magnificent view, but sharing it with my pokemon makes it even greater.</p>
<p>~&quot;Master?&quot;</p>
<p>My very first pokemon asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Lopunny?&quot;</p>
<p>She rubs her head against my chest before she continues talking. ~&quot;I know what my first reward is going to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your first?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I won the gym battle on my own, it&#x27;s only fair that I get Riolu&#x27;s and Salandit&#x27;s rewards as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The pokemon in question want to protest but a glare by Lopunny was enough to shut them up.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. Alright, what is you first wish. Do note, I cannot grant extra wishes, I cannot bring back people from the dead, and I cannot create love.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;... Aha.&quot; She didn&#x27;t get the reference. ~&quot;For my first wish, I wish to receive goodnight-kisses, the same kind that Dawn and Zoey get.&quot;</p>
<p>Just one single kiss on her lips? That&#x27;s all she wants? It&#x27;s not like we didn&#x27;t accidentally kiss each other on the lips before.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Your wish shall be granted.&quot;</p>
<p>I lean down and meet her furry, puckered lips with mine.</p>
<p>They do surprisingly taste of caramel and hazelnut. Perhaps her shampoo has started to affect her weirdly, or she just actually tastes like that.</p>
<p>Either way, the tongue that suddenly digs itself into my mouth wasn&#x27;t part of the deal, so I struggle to pull away.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmumpf.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t escape.</p>
<p>Lopunny is too strong.</p>
<p>I feel her tongue moving past my lips, over my teeth, across my tongue, and if hers was any longer, I would have felt it travel down my throat as well.</p>
<p>She is relentless in her exploration of my mouth and I&#x27;m powerless to stop her.</p>
<p>Unlike Dawn, she clearly isn&#x27;t shy. And it doesn&#x27;t feel as passionate as Zoey either. It&#x27;s more curiosity. As if she&#x27;s trying to map out the entirety of my mouth with her tongue.</p>
<p>Until, with an actual audible plop, she pulls herself back and stares at me with her wide open eyes and a manic grin spread on her face.</p>
<p>The next moment she presses her face against my neck and rubs herself against it.</p>
<p>Cute.</p>
<p>~&quot;And I can&#x27;t believe you agreed to do this for every night.&quot; She mumbles, and I can&#x27;t believe my own ears.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean? I agreed to a single goodnight kiss and that wasn&#x27;t a goodnight kiss.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks up again. Mischief sparkles in her eyes as she grins at me.</p>
<p>~&quot;I asked for kisses. Multiple. And I have seen what you and Zoey do each night. You should have been more careful about the kinds of wishes you grant, master.&quot;</p>
<p>Her husky voice drags out the final word and it makes my heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>~&quot;You got tricked by the rabbit...&quot; Salandit&#x27;s disappointed voice kicks my heart back into regular working condition.</p>
<p>Lopunny and Salandit begin to argue as usual afterwards.</p>
<p>Damn it. She&#x27;s right. Even though I was supposed to be tricky with the wish granting.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the second time we have tongue kissed now. And it was the second time that it really wasn&#x27;t all that bad.</p>
<p>Different, definitely weird, but not bad.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s not illegal either. And she&#x27;s so happy because of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. Alright. You win, this time.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;What?&quot; Lopunny looks up at me. She was too preoccupied with her and Salandit&#x27;s quarrels.</p>
<p>&quot;You can have daily goodnight kisses. Just... let&#x27;s not let the girls see it, at least. Alright? We&#x27;re being weird; And I don&#x27;t want others to know how weird I am.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Deal!&quot; Once again she presses and rubs her head against my neck.</p>
<p>Salandit pokes her head into my view. ~&quot;Can I have those too?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;No!&quot; Lopunny shouts and screeches at the top of her lungs. ~&quot;You didn&#x27;t earn them! I did! You don&#x27;t get them!&quot;</p>
<p>. . . I guess that&#x27;s my life now.</p>
<p>They start another round of flinging insults at each other.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Narrator-POV:</strong></p>
<p>The hero and his team of trusted companions rest for the rest of the day. They cuddle, watch the stars, feel each other&#x27;s warmth, and enjoy the most marvelous sight imaginable.</p>
<p>The stars twinkle, their reflections on the calm ocean follow their lead, and every once in a while a pillar pulsates with power.</p>
<p>They are roots and growths from the tree of life.</p>
<p>It has spread its roots all over the Sinnoh region and protects the continent from collapsing into the grand underground. Its roots can even withstand the mightiest of space-quakes.</p>
<p>A wild Mandibuzz flaps her enormous wings every few minutes as she watches our group of heroes from far above. She circles them a few times; thinking, plotting and waiting.</p>
<p>In the end, she flies off again. Her potential prey outnumbers her and they looked far too happy and healthy to be carrion.</p>
<p>Over night, the pokemon manage their guard duties and they get as much rest as they can.</p>
<p>Riolu always volunteers to take the first watch. She uses the time to meditate and train her aura while keeping her mental eye out for predators at the same time.</p>
<p>Salandit takes the second shift. Once she is sure everyone else is fast asleep, she rummages around in Swole&#x27;s backpack.</p>
<p>Tonight, she pulled out a Nentindo 3DS, played the game &quot;animals&quot; on it for a bit, then returned it again.</p>
<p>~&quot;Animals are boring.&quot; She determines and eventually passes guard duty over to Lopunny.</p>
<p>She spends the rest of the night going over her master plan. Step by step, she has a plan to reach her goal. One of her goals.</p>
<p>A plan she spent hours on to fine tune and improve.</p>
<p>Countless hours.</p>
<p>... It boils down to &#x27;do what Zoey did&#x27;.</p>
<p>She is not great at planning.</p>
<p>However, her ears are perked and listening for his heartbeat. She needs to be ready for the moment he wakes up.</p>
<p>She cannot use the sun or the brightness as an indicator to help her either. But she has the determination and endurance to see the next step of her plan to fruition.</p>
<p>She spots the change in his heartbeat and gets ready.</p>
<p>She moves her face directly above his.</p>
<p>And when his eyes squeeze open through a layer of sleep-sand, she is ready. ~&quot;Good morning.&quot; She whispers before softly biting his earlobe.</p>
<p>A twitch, a slight movement she feels near her groin, clues her in on the success of her operation, and she stands up again.</p>
<p>Her job is far from over.</p>
<p>She moves her hands over her ears as if they were hair and strikes a pose. Her hips are pushed to the side, her torso bends just a bit and her legs are spread apart, as she motions for him to get closer.</p>
<p>~&quot;Come on, master.&quot; She whispers. ~&quot;Get up. We need to get going.&quot;</p>
<p>A grin spreads over her face when she hears him mutter, &quot;I&#x27;m already up.&quot;</p>
<p>Needless to say, Swole Solo, the hero of Twinleaf Town, had an uncomfortable morning with an unnecessary tension in his pants.</p>
<p>And it will not be his only uncomfortable morning either. For their march is arduous, difficult, and long.</p>
<p>They walk north, along the shore until the environment changes once more. They find the end of the underground ocean and enter a vast land of salt flats.</p>
<p>As far as the eye can see, and further, there is nothing ahead of them.</p>
<p>A completely flat landscape with ground that sparkles from the dim lights of the crystals above.</p>
<p>Each step they take sounds out with the crunching noise of cracking salt crystals.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a lot of salt.&quot;</p>
<p>Swole says after they walked for a day and they see only salt in every direction.</p>
<p>For a whole day, they walk through the salty desert where they see nothing else but darkness and salt.</p>
<p>At night, they drink, they rest, they kiss, they seethe, and the next morning everything repeats again.</p>
<p>Monotony.</p>
<p>As beautiful as the sight is, it is all they get. No wind, no sun, no clouds, no sounds. Except when they move.</p>
<p>With every step they take, the ground crunches as their feet crush salt crystals to crumbs.</p>
<p>~&quot;Can we take a break, master?&quot;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Lopunny is the first to succumb to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The salt has driven moisture out of the soles on her feet. The once soft paw pads have become cracked, hard, calloused and bloody from the day&#x27;s march.</p>
<p>Swole treats them with potion, a moisturizing salve that Dawn insisted he would need, binds them up in bandages, and finally crafts a pair of shoes to the best of his abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. I wish Akari was here. She could have made proper boots for you.&quot; He also really misses her. But the utilitarian reason is the only one he is willing to say out loud. </p>
<p>&quot;At least, Salandit was able to find her crafting supplies in my backpack. I had no idea she kept some of it there.&quot;</p>
<p>Akari stores crafting supplies everywhere, for crafting related emergencies.</p>
<p>After solving their current emergency, they get up on their feet once more and restart their journey.</p>
<p>Walk, eat, drink, rest, kiss, seethe, sleep, repeat.</p>
<p>For three days, nothing changes.</p>
<p>... Until, they find a little island in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>A tiny thing, but oh-so obvious within their monotonous world.</p>
<p>The siren&#x27;s island beckons our group closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s check it out.&quot;</p>
