<p><strong>Riolu-POV:</strong></p>
<p>Yaaawn. I smack my lips a couple of times as I stretch my limbs as far as they can reach... Which isn&#x27;t a lot.</p>
<p>I feel like a cripple. Every moment of my new life reminds me of what I used to have. Sometimes I wonder if reviving me was even worth it.</p>
<p>But everything I do, my thoughts wander to him, and how happy he has been when he found out I have returned to life. The most important person in my life.</p>
<p>Daddy-- no, Swole. Or master. I need to defeat the base urges of my body. He still believes I am entirely Lucario, but I wonder how much of that is just his wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Would he be angry or sad if he found out?</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Lucario.&quot;</p>
<p>... No reaction. They are still asleep. I was the last on night guard duty.</p>
<p>Does it matter if I am or aren&#x27;t Lucario? One day, I will be, and then there really won&#x27;t be such a difference between us. She used to be an honorable aura guardian, and I don&#x27;t plan to be any lesser than her.</p>
<p>I will surpass her, no matter what it takes.</p>
<p>And for that, I will need to improve my aura as much as I can.</p>
<p>Thus, I close my eyes. I feel my aura feelers rising up on their own. I open my mind&#x27;s eye.</p>
<p>A dark world greets me. Shining beacons of life energy sleep safely right behind me, everything else is empty.</p>
<p>Not a single sign of life nearby. Not even a leaf of grass or a bug or worm. No, there is something. Far off in the north, where we must travel to... To do what again?</p>
<p>We must travel north, but why?</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a faint sign of life just at the edge of my aura&#x27;s range. Grass and a sleeping pokemon. Can&#x27;t tell who it is. Too far away and too blurry.</p>
<p>Does it know we are here? It should have heard us when... Lopunny and daddy-- master had their fun.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s waking up. I feel his blood coursing through his veins a little faster than before.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gdmorni...&quot; His eyes are still closed. &quot;Riolu?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. There is a pokemon around 400 meters north. On the route we plan to take.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Hold on.&quot; His blood rushes even faster and I feel his head turn to try and look at it. &quot;A pokemon? An enemy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;400 meters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s insane. How are you making progress so quickly?&quot;</p>
<p>I tilt my head 45 degrees. The universal &#x27;huh&#x27; gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m still far from 100 meters range, and the day before we fell down here, you were still at my level.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that.&quot; I wag my feelers. &quot;I&#x27;m built for it. And all I did while we traveled was practice aura.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel his hand move closer to me and I tilt my head towards him. &quot;Can I touch them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like they are sensitive. &quot;They are solid.&quot; He gently moves them around. &quot;Like steel. And heavy too. I wonder how they work...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not letting you dissect them.&quot; I pull my feelers back and hide them behind my paws.</p>
<p>He just laughs my concern off and scratches me behind my ears until I shake him off.</p>
<p>The motion woke up Lopunny and Salandit. &quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny is just barely awake and seems to be content to continue lying on Swole.</p>
<p>Salandit looks around. &quot;Enemies nearby?&quot; She asks me, probably because she saw I was still using aura, and Lopunny stirs upright.</p>
<p>&quot;North. One pokemon. Not yet an enemy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shouls we ambush it, master?&quot; Lopunny suggests, itching for another fight.</p>
<p>I could use another battle too. I feel like all this salt is rusting my bones. Luckily, I&#x27;m not a rusty old steel type pokemon just yet.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure. We could try talking to it too. I think we could have almost avoided fighting Hatterene, if only we knew what she wanted in the first place. Let&#x27;s put it to a vote. Who wants to talk?&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody rises their paws. Or claws, or hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Who wants to ambush?&quot; </p>
<p>No replay again.</p>
<p>&quot;... You want to fight without ambushing...&quot;</p>
<p>I rise my hand and see Lopunny and Salandit follow suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit? Even you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ssorry, master. I&#x27;m all for asymmetric warfare, but I need more fighting experience&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. Let&#x27;s scout it out first and then see. I don&#x27;t want to risk another fight like the one against Hatterene while help is quite literally a world away.&quot;</p>
<p>The underworld, as he calls it. Or sometimes the hollow earth. We are so deep below ground, I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how we are going to escape.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t feel the ceiling with my aura, so I finally open my eyes to look at it. It&#x27;s very pretty.</p>
<p>Twinkling stars are beautiful, but we have barely seen anything else in days. It&#x27;s starting to lose its appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go, Riolu.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; I spaced out. Da-- Swole hands me a couple of pellets.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s Pecha Berry flavored. And you don&#x27;t want to know the rest of the ingredients today.&quot;</p>
<p>Heh. I doubt I will. He optimized them for nutrition and knowing which mundane animal he squeezed into a tiny pellet like that doesn&#x27;t really enhance its taste. </p>
<p>Probably a fish. It&#x27;s a little crunchy inside. Fish bones. Yucky.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, let&#x27;s head out.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Da-- Swole,&quot; He looks at me weirdly. &quot;It&#x27;s a Dracovish.&quot; His face twists into a baffled visage. &quot;I could take him with a little help from Salandit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way that&#x27;s a Dracovish. Dracovish aren&#x27;t real.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m sure. His shape is completely clear to me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No... Salandit, prepare Toxic, Riolu, Ice Beam... But I have to make sure... Wild Dracovish don&#x27;t exist... Wait for my signal before you fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Understood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesss, ssssir.&quot;</p>
<p>He turns on his flashlight and brightens up the entire area in front of us. A couple dozen meters in front of us, a wild Dracovish startles awake. His head, which is mounted on his tail looks around in panic while his legs starts sprinting in circles.</p>
<p>His head looks to his legs and shouts something before they stop sprinting randomly, and he runs away. A couple dozen meters further away is a river which feeds this area with the moisture it needs to grow plants.</p>
<p>Swole just stands there, his mouth open wide in shock. &quot;Swole? Where is the signal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You gotta be shitting me. A real fucking Dracovish...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Massster?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong></p>
<p>It hops into the river and we lose every advantage we had. He uses Whirlpool and creates dozens of whirlpools all over the river. It blocks the way forward, nobody would try to fight him in his environment... Does he actually capture anything with that strategy?</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s leave. I don&#x27;t like him.&quot; Master just walks off, upstream, while Dracovish is busy making more whirlpools. &quot;Something&#x27;s wrong with that thing. Diseased, maybe... I can&#x27;t believe Doctor Cara Liss was right... No... It must have been a Ditto. Or perhaps Mew?&quot;</p>
<p>I take a look back and sense Dracovish at the bottom of the river, waiting for something to fall in his maelstrom.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t look back, Riolu. This thing doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#x27;s in denial.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no universe in which fraudulent sham Doctor Cara Liss was right.&quot;</p>
<p>We continue to walk along the river and leave the very real Dracovish behind until we reach a small waterfall. Three or four meters tall at most.</p>
<p>A flowery aroma comes from up there.</p>
<p>The river&#x27;s origin is somewhere up a weird-looking cliff. It looks like someone removed the ground with a razor sharp edge.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve seen that before.&quot; Swole comments and I see Lopunny and Salandit nodding along.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you were still an egg, at the edge of the Tree of Beginning. The entire area was, like, teleported into Sinnoh. I&#x27;m guessing this underground area is the same, and it&#x27;s made up out of multiple pieces.&quot; </p>
<p>He points up. &quot;Up there is another piece.&quot; And then he begins do dig through his backpack for climbing equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing, master?&quot; Lopunny asks with a grin on her face that tells me she has planned something.</p>
<p>&quot;I need a grappling hook, or dig some kind of foothold. I can&#x27;t scale the smooth wall otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here, let me help you out.&quot;</p>
<p>She suddenly picks him up bridal style - so cute - and then jumps up.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Swole screams while I hold on tight to his shoulder. I even wrap my legs around his arm to stay on.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssshit!&quot; Salandit fell off and smacks with her back into the ground below, while we land gracefully on top of the ledge. &quot;Hey! You used your ear to throw me off!&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny puts us down again. &quot;Whoops. I didn&#x27;t mean to. I&#x27;m sorry, Salandit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stupid rabbit.&quot; Salandit grumbles while she scales up the wall as if she was walking on regular soil. &quot;I will pay it all back once I evolve... Shit bunny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing...&quot;</p>
<p>She wouldn&#x27;t get treated like that if she just accepted her place. Silly lizard. When will she learn?</p>
<p>My nose picks up a new smell. A pokemon. I quickly use aura to check and sense it&#x27;s just a little Metapod hiding in the tall grass nearby.</p>
<p>Oh! &quot;Oh, wow! Look! It&#x27;s so many flowers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are everywhere!&quot;</p>
<p>I snap open my eyes to see the new sight without aura, and it&#x27;s beautiful. Thousands of flowers blossoming in the dark, their petals mirror the blue light from the crystals above.</p>
<p>Some even glow! There is white and yellow steeped into the mix. Some are even pink!</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy? Can we stay here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t.&quot; He rubs the top of my head. &quot;We need to travel north again, as soon as we can find a place to cross the river. But I&#x27;m sure we will see these flowers for a while... I just hope this area isn&#x27;t as large as the salt flats.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah right. North. Because... stuff is north, I guess.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, I wish I had a flying type pokemon on our team, just to shortcut travel at least a little.&quot;</p>
<p>He lets out a sigh that he forcefully corrects into a good grief again.</p>
<p>&quot;You can ride me anytime, master.&quot; Lopunny wags her massive eyebrows suggestively and Swole blushes.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on.&quot; Salandit is tense. Her tongue darts out of her mouth. &quot;An enemy is nearby.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. It&#x27;s just a Metapod in that grass over there.</p>
<p>&quot;Thiss grassss?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Salandit uses Ember.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s super effective.</p>
<p>Metapod is KO.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I eat it? Ouch.&quot; Sqole flicked his finger against her snoot.</p>
<p>&quot;You can take an egg out of the backpack. Leave the wildlife alone.&quot; He walks up to the tall grass, kicks a few flames out, uses a few spritzes of a potion on Metapod and carries it into a new set of tall grass.</p>
<p><strong>Crunch sluuurp</strong></p>
<p>Yuck. She eats her food so weirdly.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a good spot to cross the river.&quot;</p>
<p>The section of the river has become very wide, shallow, slow, and incredibly clear. It&#x27;s easy to see any approaching enemies; In this case, Magikarp and Goldeen.</p>
<p>There are a couple of islands in the river which are covered in vast arrays of glowing and reflecting flowers and grasses, and the same plants reappear on each side of the river.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful place, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Swole asks as he takes in the view. &quot;I bet this is what the experience of the first gym challenges must have been like. It was invented before we had routes after all. Everywhere they traveled, nature was left untouched, untamed and wild.&quot;</p>
<p>I barely traveled through the routes. We mostly went through the wilderness to travel between the towns and cities.</p>
<p>&quot;Riolu, can you check up and down the river if there are any stronger pokemon around? I don&#x27;t want to get a nasty surprise in the water.&quot;</p>
<p>I nod and after a quick double check give him the confirmation that the river is safe to traverse.</p>
<p>Lopunny leads the way once more. She takes large leaps from one rock to another to avoid stepping into the cold, but calm waters. &quot;Are you coming?&quot; She turned around in the middle of the river to goad Swole into hurrying up. &quot;Hurry up, Slowpoke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; He answers, steps back and runs to jump to the first dry rock, almost overshooting his target and almost falling forward into the water.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Are you inssane?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Get your claws out of my shoulder!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only if you wade through the water like a normal persson!&quot; The least normal pokemon suggests. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get wet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don&#x27;t want to get wet either, and I don&#x27;t wear any rubber boots right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nooo!&quot; She whines.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to wait it out in your pokeball?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nooo!&quot; Her whinery continues.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, no? It&#x27;s either the pokeball or you&#x27;re going down with me. Ouch! Stop it with your claws!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit,&quot; I ask and she stops struggling for a moment. &quot;Have you tried thinking of something nice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like a river of acid? ... Good idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great.&quot; Swole says. &quot;We&#x27;re playing the floor is acid and I can only touch the rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you actually close your eyes?&quot; I hold on to Swole&#x27;s neck to peek around him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oi, oi, no gymnastics on me. And hold on, I&#x27;m jumping again.&quot;</p>
<p>He swings his arms to gain more momentum, shaking Salandit and me in the process. &quot;Hup!&quot;</p>
<p>And again. And again. It&#x27;s a rather wide, but very shallow river.</p>
<p>But then he stops. Just a few more rocks, but--</p>
<p>&quot;Hi.&quot; Lopunny stands in the way. She set her sights on Swole.</p>
<p>He tries to look past her but almost slips again. Lopunny holds him by his arms to keep him stable. &quot;Thanks. You&#x27;re in the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could you move?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nnnope. Maybe after you paid the bridge toll.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This can hardly be called a bridge. It&#x27;s just a bunch of rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can take a different set of rocks if you don&#x27;t like my bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>He would need to backtrack for three rocks before he can take another route.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the bridge toll?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what it is.&quot; Her head leans closer.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m stealing that for Dawn...&quot; I hear him mutter. &quot;Ahem. I can take a guess.&quot;</p>
<p>He leans closer. Lopunny closes her eyes. He wraps his arms around her body. &quot;Sorry, Salandit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Splash</strong></p>
<p>Urgh! My fur!  </p>
<p>&quot;His his his his!&quot; Salandit laughs. She sits on the rock, her forelegs braced in front of her and her ass seated on the dry surface as she laughs at us.</p>
<p>I fell off his shoulder while he body slammed Lopunny into the water together with himself. I tread the water a few times before I realize it&#x27;s shallow enough to stand in.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I guess right?&quot; His shit eating grin threatens to split his face. &quot;Woah!&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny wrestles with him in the water until she&#x27;s on top, and Swole&#x27;s face barely peeks out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Woah!&quot; She&#x27;s too strong! My head dips underwater before I turn the fight around and gain the advantage. I wrap my leg around both of hers and use my body weight to wrestle her under water.</p>
<p>But then she pushes herself off with her ears and I&#x27;m on the bottom once more. Her hands press my shoulders down, her thighs lock my legs in place, and her ears give her the stability so that no matter how I push or pull, she stays on top.</p>
<p>Water drips down her face and onto mine. Her shit eating grin threatens to split her face. &quot;You won&#x27;t escape the toll so easily. Everyone too weak to fight me must pay it.&quot;</p>
<p>The scariest part; A small part of me looks forward to it.</p>
<p>Slowly, her face inches closer to mine. Her hands shift from my shoulder to holding my face in place. With my torso freed, I could fight again, but I don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Her lips press against mine. Her eyes close and so do mine.</p>
<p>The water surrounds my head, all but my face is underwater and so I can only hear her movements reverberate through my skull as she pushes her tongue against my teeth.</p>
<p>She gently massages my cheeks, uses her thumbs to coax my jaw into granting her access... and I grant it.</p>
<p>I open my mouth and feel her tongue scrape past my teeth and seek out my own. It feels thinner than a human&#x27;s.</p>
<p>A moan vibrates through her mouth into mine. </p>
<p>Her whiskers brush against my cheeks because of it.</p>
<p>Her lips are so soft, thin and furry. Her tongue is so agile and relentless in its exploration of my mouth.</p>
<p>Her bunny tail shakes left and right, knocking into my hands as they--</p>
<p>Where did my hands wander?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I doing?! I need to stop! I can&#x27;t be doing that with my pokemon!</p>
<p>I move my hands to stem against her shoulders. With all my might, I push her off, but she barely budges.</p>
<p>But her mouth lets go of me. ~&quot;Do you need to breathe already?&quot; She smacks her lips. ~&quot;I could have done that for a few more minutes at least.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t help but swallow down my dread at the thought. It didn&#x27;t taste like my usual saliva.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t push her off. She let me go.</p>
<p>The tiny bit I lifted her was because she didn&#x27;t have a grip on me. Her hands just held my head steady. As soon as I struggled, she had held me by my shoulders and wouldn&#x27;t budge.</p>
<p>Pokemon are so much stronger than humans, it&#x27;s not even funny.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I sensed something through aura.&quot; I lie. &quot;We need to get out of here and continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Like pulling a switch, she jumps up and transforms from her <strong>playful</strong> mood to her fighting stance.</p>
<p>I stand up. The water is ankle-deep but I am drenched. I feel the extra weight in my boots.</p>
<p>... Lopunny urges me to hurry up and leave the dangerous waters.</p>
<p>After picking up Riolu who seems to be deep in thought, and Salandit who complains about being picked up - ~&quot;Yuck! Sstop! You&#x27;re wet! Don&#x27;t touch me!&quot; - after picking them up, we continue through the river, into the flower fields beyond it, and travel further north.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Riolu-POV:</strong></p>
<p>I saw him struggle, but I know I&#x27;m powerless to stop Lopunny.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s fucked. </p>
<p>Maybe, truly fucked.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s simply too strong for Salandit and me.</p>
<p>&quot;Psst.&quot; I try to catch Salandit&#x27;s attention. &quot;Psst, Salandit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesss?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; I&#x27;m whispering so Lopunny won&#x27;t hear us.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m thinking you underestimate her ears. You can&#x27;t whisper quietly enough so she won&#x27;t hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny just nods as she leads the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Sssigh. Other than that, I think I have lost my place as number one. She&#x27;ss sso sstrong, it&#x27;s not even funny anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>I nod. &quot;If she wants to claim Swole first, then she&#x27;ll just do it, won&#x27;t she? And we can&#x27;t stop her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yess... masster iss fucked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;G-good grief! Can you girls stop talking about that?!&quot; I heard that stutter. &quot;Nobody is getting fucked. We&#x27;ll just train, and fight, and eventually we will become the next champion. Like every other trainer tries to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll,&quot; Lopunny pipes up. &quot;Maybe every other trainer does it wrong and that&#x27;s why they can&#x27;t beat Cynthia?&quot;</p>
<p>Ha! That&#x27;s the weakest excuse I ever heard. What a horny rabbit.</p>
<p>And she&#x27;s not even--</p>
<p>Wait. What&#x27;s that? &quot;Something is coming from the sky!&quot;</p>
<p>That was a stupid thing to say.</p>
<p>&quot;What sky? We&#x27;re underground.&quot; Lopunny of all pokemon corrects me.</p>
<p>&quot;Above us! He&#x27;s a Hydreigon!&quot;</p>
<p>Swole begins to panic immediately. &quot;Hydreigon!? Are you kidding me? What is a fully evolved dragon pokemon doing here?!&quot; And then he switches to a mutter while the massive pokemon approaches through the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Dark and dragon type... huge stats but known for their special attack moves like Dragon Pulse, Hyper Beam and Dark Pulse... Fighting type and ice are good options... Damn it!&quot; He suddenly curses. &quot;I knew we should have spent more time training Play Rough!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s 50 meters away.&quot; I inform him and get ready to use Protect in case he uses a surprise attack.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; Salandit points him out with her claw.</p>
<p>&quot;I see him! Riolu, get ready for Protect!&quot;</p>
<p>Already on it.</p>
<p>The wind picks up. A noticeable change because I haven&#x27;t felt the wind brush over my fur in days.</p>
<p>A cold feeling spreads over the area, like a blanket of thick unease. The signs of a dark type pokemon approaching. I feel a shiver run across Swole&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>Dark types don&#x27;t scare me. I eat them for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Whomp</strong></p>
<p>Never mind. He&#x27;s huge.</p>
<p>The ground shook when he landed just a few meters in front of us. His bulky tail smacks into the ground threateningly. Six dark wings weave through the air, creating far more draft than the spindly-looking things should.</p>
<p>He has one head where it&#x27;s supposed to be and two more instead of hands. The head on his left hand lets out an aggressive roar.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we have here? A couple of snacks sneaking through my territory? What should we do with them, boys?&quot; The center head asks, and the one on the left hand replies.</p>
<p>&quot;They should pay a toll! A fee for crossing through <strong>our</strong> territory!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! YES! Make them pay! Hihihue.&quot; The third and final head says with a deranged laugh.</p>
<p>My eyes shift to Lopunny. It feels like it&#x27;s her fault that Hydreigon appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;What did he-- uh they say?&quot; Swole asks, and I translate for him.</p>
<p>His head turns to look at Lopunny. She flinches under his stare.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. Alright. What is the toll we must pay?&quot;</p>
<p>Again, the center head leads the negotiation. &quot;I&#x27;m feeling rather peckish. I could have a bite or two. How about... three of your companions? Pay me the meat of your companions and you can pass, human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We</strong> are hungry. Make it six companions, human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! YES! Six is more than three! Hihihue.&quot;</p>
<p>I translate it all to the best of my abilities... Even the gibberish that the third head says. I feel like I&#x27;m becoming stupider by listening to the right head, I don&#x27;t want to think about him more than I need to.</p>
<p>&quot;How about a counter offer. What if I fed you nine of my former companions, and you let all four of us pass?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like that is a trick. He&#x27;s another human with his cowardly tricks. I demand your current companions, human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We</strong> demand your current and past companions, human!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! YES! I accept! Hihihue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The third head said yes.&quot; I translate.</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; Swole pulls out nine steaks from his backpack and throws them to Hydreigon. &quot;Here you go. Nine of my old companions. Prepared and ready to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>They aren&#x27;t even cooked yet. There is no way this will work.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! YES! Nine is more than six! Hihihue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You idiot!&quot; The center head tries to bite the right head as he tries to bite the steak.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s <strong>our</strong> head! <strong>We</strong> can&#x27;t kill it!&quot;</p>
<p>The left head struggles to keep the center head in check.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. YES! So tasty! Hihihue.&quot; He swallowed the first steak whole while Swole makes a huge circle around the quarreling pokemon and then runs.</p>
<p>The noise of fighting picks up before it becomes quieter the more we run away.</p>
<p>The river leaves my sight and then the range of my aura. We continue to run through the vast fields of flowers until our steps are the only sounds we can still hear and then some more just to be sure.</p>
<p>&quot;Whew. That was close.&quot; Swole says.</p>
<p>Lopunny crosses her arms and pouts. &quot;Close? We could have just fought them.&quot; She closes in on Swole and hovers threateningly over him. &quot;Instead, you wasted my precious steak supply on that- those idiots!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His his his.&quot; Salandit lets out slow paced laughter. &quot;Very funny. The pot callss the kettle black.&quot;</p>
<p>She switches her threat to Salandit but the face Lopunny pulls tells me she doesn&#x27;t get it. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d better mean nothing by it.&quot;</p>
<p>I can hear Salandit swallow.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny, calm down.&quot; Swole tries to be the voice of reason but despite her large ears, she is deaf to reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down?&quot; She looks back to Swole and tries to stare down at him, even though their heads are on the same height. &quot;It was <em>my</em> food! And--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>And</strong> we don&#x27;t know how many pokemon we would have to fight today. Even if we won, what if the fight attracted more pokemon than we could handle? Or he could have his family waiting on standby to overrun us!&quot;</p>
<p>Her defiant gaze is incredibly intimidating. And I&#x27;m not even the target. I&#x27;m just an innocent bystander. Sigh. I miss my old strength. She wouldn&#x27;t dare to act like that with my <em>former</em> self around.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remind me, Lopunny. Why am I the trainer?&quot;</p>
<p>She finally breaks his gaze and looks down. &quot;Because you make good decisions...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re right. And who would have died without me in the past?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Me.&quot; She whispers but can still be clearly heard.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have died without your good decisions in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. And that&#x27;s why when I say we avoid a fight, we avoid the fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good... Now come here.&quot;</p>
<p>She slowly approaches him. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s alright.&quot; He reaches out with his arms and hugs her tightly.</p>
<p>For almost a minute she does nothing but submit to him in his embrace.</p>
<p>And then, it abruptly ends.</p>
<p>Swole looks into the distance. A frown forms on his face. He must be deep in thought. Probably thinking about how to properly punish Lopunny for her increasingly disobedient behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone else think the horizon looks a little weird?&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? It&#x27;s just more crystals that glow like stars. I guess the ones closer to the horizon appear to be larger.</p>
<p>He turns on his flashlight and I see what he meant.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a wall. Entirely smooth, except for the few crystalline growths. As the wall reaches higher it curves and transitions into the ceiling. As if something removed a sphere, or rather an ovoid, from the planet&#x27;s crust and filled the bottom half with the ground we walk on.</p>
<p>But right in front of us, just a couple dozen meters...</p>
<p>His mouth drops open in disbelief at the sight that awaits us.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s an ancient temple.&quot; Swole describes. &quot;There might be humans nearby!&quot;</p>
<p>Standing right against the wall is a massive building built from white marble. Pillars, as thick as Swole is tall, line the front of the facade.</p>
